Bio of Emily

####About Me

Hi there, My name is Emily and I'm in my first year as a CS major here at OSU. I'm actually a junior in school but I switched into CS from Biology/Psychology and I love it, even though it means an extra two years of school.  

When I'm not doing homework or with my friends I'm usually playing video games, hiking, reading, or doing something artistic. Netflix binges are also a common occurrence. Some of the artistic outlets I had previously that led me to CS were playing with HTML and CSS. I've excited to pursue them more this term and learn so PHP on top of it.  

Some random knowledge about me:  
- My favorite color is purple  
- I could live off of chocolate  
- I know more about slime mold than probably anyone you know  
- I have a Munchkin cat (google them, they're adorable)  


####Programming Background

Before this year I had never programmed before, and my first experience with anything of the sort was actually HTML and CSS. I played with them for about six months before branching out to Python and then beginning the intro to programming classes here at OSU. I initially came into the CS program with the intention of pursuing web development so I'm very interested in how I'll like this course. 

So far in the courses here I've done C++, C, Assembly, and Python, which I've enjoyed but I'm excited to learn others and see what else is out there. The programming projects have ranged from dull to useful to cool, but the ones I enjoyed most involved a visual element such as Xming graphics or Conway's Game of Life. I think that's why I enjoy HTML and CSS so much is because it has a visual output. 

####Future Plans

I still don't know exactly what I plan to focus on in my applied degree but I'm still seriously considering web related things so this class will be a great look into those possibility. Data Science and the wide field of big data fascinates me, and is where I've currently been focusing my attention. Only time will tell.
