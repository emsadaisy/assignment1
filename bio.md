Bio of Emily

####About Me

Hi there, My name is Emily and I'm in my first year as a CS major here at OSU. I'm actually a junior in school but I switched into CS from Biology/Psychology and I love it, even though it means an extra two years of school. 

When I'm not doing homework or with my friends I'm usually playing video games, hiking, reading, or doing something artistic. Netflix binges are also a common occurrence. Some of the artistic outlets I had previously that led me to CS were playing with HTML and CSS. I've excited to pursue them more this term and learn so PHP on top of it.
