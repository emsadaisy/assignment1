Bio of Emily

####About Me

Hi there, My name is Emily and I'm in my first year as a CS major here at OSU. I'm actually a junior in school but I switched into CS from Biology/Psychology and I love it, even though it means an extra two years of school. 

When I'm not doing homework or with my friends I'm usually playing video games, hiking, reading, or doing something artistic. Netflix binges are also a common occurrence.

####Programming Background

Before this year I had never programmed before, and my first experience with anything of the sort was actually HTML and CSS. I played with them for about six months before branching out to Python and then beginning the intro to programming classes here at OSU. I initially came into the CS program with the intention of pursuing web development so I'm very interested in how I'll like this course.
